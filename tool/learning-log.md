Project: Making a song

* So far, I have been working on EarSketch since the Zdog website was not working. For now, I have just been trying to make a short song that contains some genres of musics like synth, latin, and funk. I have been following the instructions shown on [the website](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/) for now to help me with the basics. I wanted to try to figure out how to make it so that different beats and rhythms play at different periods of time. However, the instructions are a little bit confusing at the moment but I will try to some examples of how it is used and how to use it properly.
