* So far, I have been working on EarSketch since the Zdog website was not working. For now, I have just been trying to make a short song that contains some genres of musics like synth, latin, and funk. I have been following the instructions shown on [the website](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/) for now to help me with the basics. I wanted to try to figure out how to make it so that different beats and rhythms play at different periods of time. However, the instructions are a little bit confusing at the moment but I will try to some examples of how it is used and how to use it properly.

12/10/23
* Added songs from Freesound
* Trying to learn how make a sound crescendo (raising the volume of a sound over time)

01/15/24
* Learned how to increase the volume of certain sounds
* Still trying to figure out if there is a way to increase the volume of a sound over time (crescendo)
* Going to add more sounds and will figure out which sounds will be quieter or louder.

01/21/24
* Placing different downloaded sounds in different points of time to make the song sound better
* Figuring out if I can make the same sound play at different points multiple times in the same row
* Going to add some sounds that make its sound like there is something lurking

02/11/24
* Tweaked some of the sounds to fit into the right places
* Going to add one or two more sounds to my song
* Going to start using Zdog as my Beyond MVP after I finish my song
