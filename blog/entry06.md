# Entry 6
##### 06/02/24

For one to two weeks, me and my classmates have worked on futher improving our Year-Long-Projects with our tools for the SEP ExpoWe had finished most of the work that was needed to be done. All we had left was to make improvements to make our projects the best they can be. On the last week before the Expo, we worked on making slides that would present our projects and why we made them. Making the slides for my project was fairly easy since the tool that I had used to make my project was also easy to use. I had even written out an [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QpoVV1gkEyaLoqZO4-PHPZMv6R5y9hmqlwYDtp_OQrE/edit?usp=sharing) that I could have used when presenting my slides
